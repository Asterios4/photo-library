Project 

This is the result I was able to achieve for the project and what it implements:

This application is a photo library built with Angular that includes:

- An infinite scroll of random photos with dynamic loading on scroll.
- The ability to add and remove photos from "Favorites."
- Persistence of favorite photos in localStorage to keep them after page refresh.
- Navigation between "Photos," "Favorites," and single photo view pages using Angular Router.
- Styling done with Angular Material and SCSS.
- Simulation of loading delay to mimic a real-world API.
